# VILF Site Roadmap

This site is being built in controlled phases. Public documentation will expand as each phase meets build and governance gates.

## Current focus

- Docusaurus foundation + styling parity
- Navigation and branding baseline
- Preparing for chapter migration from `/manuscript` into MDX

## Next milestones

1. Publish a stable public documentation skeleton (chapters as placeholders)
2. Migrate VILF 1.0 chapters into MDX
3. Add annexes and governance references where appropriate
4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (after pre-Docusaurus gates)

## Notes

Operational tracking and internal governance artifacts are maintained separately and are intentionally not exposed in the public navigation.
