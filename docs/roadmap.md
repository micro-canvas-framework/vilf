# VILF Site Roadmap

This site is being built in controlled phases. Public documentation will expand as each phase meets build and governance gates.

## Current focus

- Docusaurus foundation + styling parity
- Navigation and branding baseline
- Public documentation skeleton (chapters + annexes)

## What is available now

- **Chapters (skeleton):** [/docs/chapters](/docs/chapters)
- **Annexes (skeleton):** [/docs/annexes](/docs/annexes)

## Next milestones

1. Migrate VILF 1.0 chapters into MDX from `/manuscript`
2. Migrate annexes into MDX from `/manuscript`
3. Add diagrams (Mermaid) and citations per governance rules
4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (after the pre-Docusaurus phase gates)

## Notes

Internal operational tracking is maintained separately and is intentionally not exposed in the public navigation.
