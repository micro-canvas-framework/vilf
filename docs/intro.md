# Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF)

This site is being built in controlled phases. The chapter content will be migrated from **/manuscript** into MDX only after the Docusaurus
foundation and navigation/styling parity gates are complete.

## Start here

- **Project Backlog (authoritative):** [/docs/ops/vilf-backlog](/docs/ops/vilf-backlog)

## What to expect next

1. Navigation + sitemap stabilization (current)
2. Styling parity expansion (VIF + Doulab baseline)
3. Chapter migration into `/docs` (MDX) with governance gates

## Build integrity

Broken links are treated as build errors. This keeps commits clean and the operational backlog trustworthy.
