# Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF)

This site is being built in phases.

For now, the canonical operational view is the project backlog:

- **Project Backlog:** [/docs/ops/vilf-backlog](/docs/ops/vilf-backlog)

## What to expect next

1. Styling parity (VIF + Doulab palette) stabilization
2. Navigation + sitemap alignment
3. Chapter migration from `/manuscript` into MDX under `/docs`

## Notes

- Chapter content is intentionally not published yet.
- Build gates remain strict: broken links are treated as errors.
