# Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF)

This site is being built in controlled phases. The chapter content will be migrated from **/manuscript** into MDX only after the Docusaurus
foundation and navigation/styling parity gates are complete.

## Start here

- **Roadmap:** [/docs/roadmap](/docs/roadmap)
- **Chapters (skeleton):** [/docs/chapters](/docs/chapters)
- **Annexes (skeleton):** [/docs/annexes](/docs/annexes)

## What to expect next

1. Publish a stable public documentation skeleton (current)
2. Migrate chapters and annexes from `/manuscript` into MDX
3. Deploy (Cloudflare Pages) after pre-Docusaurus gates

## Build integrity

Broken links are treated as build errors. This keeps commits clean and the public documentation trustworthy.
