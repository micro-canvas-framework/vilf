## 12 – License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)

### How to Read This Chapter
This chapter defines the licensing rules for VILF. It has been refined to strictly match the Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–NoDerivatives 4.0 International license.

### 12.1 License Model
You may:
- copy,
- share,
- redistribute the unmodified document
for non-commercial use only, with attribution.

You may not:
- modify,
- translate,
- adapt,
- create derivatives,
- use commercially.

This model sets the core permissions and prohibitions; the next section specifies the exact attribution language required.


### 12.2 Required Attribution
Must include:
“Based on the Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF) by Doulab, part of the MicroCanvas Framework family. Licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.”

### 12.3 Scope
Allowed:
- internal non-commercial use,
- academic reference,
- redistribution unmodified.

Requires permission:
- translation,
- adaptation,
- national versions,
- commercial programs.

This scope overview provides boundary conditions; the table that follows summarizes the same rules for quick reference.


### 12.4 Permissions & Restrictions Table
Allowed?
- Copying: yes  
- Redistribution (non-commercial): yes  
- Internal government use: yes  
- Translation: no  
- Modification: no  
- National versions: no  
- Commercial use: no  
- Removing attribution: no  

These permissions align with the CC BY-NC-ND baseline; the IP clarifications below note retained protections.


### 12.5 IP Clarifications
MCF 2.1, IMM, IMM-P®, IGF, and MEL retain their protections.

### 12.6 Templates & Tools Licensing
Templates follow the same license unless third-party rules apply.

Template licensing inherits the main license by default; derivative works are explicitly restricted below.


### 12.7 Derivative Works & Versioning
No derivatives allowed without permission.

Versioning is allowed only for unmodified redistribution; repository expectations are outlined next.


### 12.8 Repository & Transparency
If published:
- must retain CC BY-NC-ND 4.0,
- no derivative PRs,
- version tagging required.

Repository requirements reinforce license integrity; cross-framework licensing is stated below.


### 12.9 Cross-Framework Licensing
All Vigía frameworks share the same license model.

### 12.10 Connection to Release Notes
Next chapter documents the version history.
