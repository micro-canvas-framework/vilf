## 04 – Operating Model

### How to Read This Chapter
The operating model translates architectural components into daily functioning. It defines roles, workflows, execution requirements, documentation standards, and collaboration patterns. It connects the system blueprint (Chapter 03) with practical behaviors and routines.

### 4.1 Purpose of the Operating Model
The operating model defines how labs, hubs, and the NCU work every day to ensure:
- predictable execution,
- capability building,
- evidence discipline,
- governance compliance,
- MEL integration,
- cross-lab collaboration,
- documentation flow.

### 4.2 Operating Model Principles
- Evidence First  
- Execution Discipline  
- Governed Autonomy  
- Transparency  
- Learning Integration  
- Scalable Processes  
- Maturity-Aligned Operations  

### 4.3 Roles and Responsibilities (Tier-0, Tier-1, Tier-2)

#### 4.3.1 Tier-0: Lab Roles
- Lab Manager  
- Service Designer  
- Experimentation Lead  
- Evidence Officer  
- Subject Matter Specialists  

#### 4.3.2 Tier-1: Hub Roles
- Hub Coordinator  
- Capability Coaches  
- Domain Specialists  
- MEL Officers  

#### 4.3.3 Tier-2: NCU Roles
- Network Director  
- Standards & Governance Unit  
- Learning & Performance Unit  
- Infrastructure Unit  

### 4.4 IMM-P® as the Execution Spine
All lab projects must execute using:
1. Pre-Discovery  
2. Discovery  
3. Validation  
4. Solution Development  
5. Implementation Pathway  

Evidence artifacts are mandatory.

### 4.5 Workflow Architecture

#### 4.5.1 Project Intake & Prioritization
Labs receive challenges from:
- sponsoring institutions,
- ecosystem actors,
- diagnostics,
- strategic priorities.

Hubs and NCU validate alignment.

#### 4.5.2 Portfolio Management
Hubs ensure:
- balanced portfolios,
- maturity consideration,
- MEL alignment,
- risk diversification.

#### 4.5.3 Collaboration Workflow
Labs collaborate through:
- shared research,
- cross-lab squads,
- domain clusters,
- hub-led capability sessions.

### 4.6 Governance Pathways
IGF decision tiers:
- Tier-0: Lab  
- Tier-1: Hub  
- Tier-2: NCU  

Escalations follow IGF rules.

### 4.7 Evidence & Documentation Standards
Labs must use:
- standardized templates,
- evidence logs,
- decision records,
- prototype logs,
- research repositories.

### 4.8 MEL Integration
MEL provides:
- quarterly review cycles,
- annual scorecards,
- performance-based funding inputs,
- learning synthesis.

### 4.9 Capability Development
The capability spine ensures:
- IMM progression,
- coaching,
- training,
- competency building.

### 4.10 Connection to Funding Model
Chapter 05 explains how operations are financed sustainably.
