# Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF) 1.0

## 00 – Executive Summary

### 0.1 Purpose of VILF
The Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF) provides a complete, structured methodology for designing, deploying, governing, scaling, and sustaining innovation labs within a national or multi-institutional ecosystem. It defines the architectural components, operational systems, funding structures, capability requirements, governance pathways, and performance mechanisms required to build a coherent innovation lab network.

VILF is part of the Vigía Framework Family (VXF) and is fully aligned with:
- MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.1)
- Innovation Maturity Model (IMM)
- IMM-P® execution cycle
- Innovation Governance Framework (IGF)
- Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL)

### 0.2 What VILF Enables
VILF allows countries or institutions to:
- build innovation labs that operate predictably,
- scale from isolated pilots to robust networks,
- integrate evidence and learning across institutions,
- establish a shared governance and performance system,
- align innovation with public value, strategic outcomes, and policy impact,
- professionalize the innovation function.

### 0.3 Who Should Use This Framework
VILF is designed for:
- governments establishing national innovation lab networks,
- universities and multi-institutional coalitions launching shared labs,
- private-sector groups building distributed innovation units,
- international organizations supporting national innovation ecosystems.

### 0.4 Structure of VILF
VILF is composed of 16 components across Chapters 00–15:
- Executive Summary  
- Introduction  
- Ecosystem Diagnostic  
- System Architecture  
- Operating Model  
- Funding Model  
- Benchmarking  
- KPIs & Scorecard  
- Roadmap & Phasing  
- Governance & Legal Toolkit  
- Templates & Tools  
- References  
- License  
- Release Notes  
- Roadmap (Future Versions)  
- Annexes  

### 0.5 How to Read This Document
This document may be read:
- linearly (Chapters 00–15),
- by functional domain (architecture, governance, funding, MEL),
- or by role (lab manager, hub coordinator, NCU director).

Each chapter ends with a connection block linking to the next chapter.

## 00a – How the Framework Works (Usability Overview)

### 00a.1 Conceptual Model
VILF is built using a three-tier architecture:
- **Tier-0: Labs** → execute innovation cycles and generate evidence.
- **Tier-1: Hubs** → coordinate multiple labs, build capability, manage portfolios.
- **Tier-2: Network Coordination Unit (NCU)** → governs standards, MEL, accreditation.

These tiers operate as a single interoperable system.
