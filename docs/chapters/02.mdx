## 02 – Ecosystem Diagnostic

### 2.1 Purpose of the Diagnostic
The diagnostic evaluates whether an institution, sector, or country is ready to deploy innovation labs, hubs, and networks using VILF (World Bank, 2022; ISO, 2019). It establishes go/no-go readiness by identifying maturity levels, capability gaps, governance barriers, and funding conditions. Diagnostic results directly condition the architecture and governance choices in subsequent chapters (OECD, 2015).

This diagram is descriptive and non-normative; it lists the five diagnostic pillars as a conceptual stack, without implying scoring or thresholds.

The diagnostic evaluates five pillars:
- **Strategic Alignment (MCF)**  
- **Governance (IGF)**  
- **Capability & Maturity (IMM)**  
- **Execution Readiness (IMM-P)**  
- **Infrastructure & Evidence Systems**  

Each pillar has a structured set of indicators. Each pillar assesses readiness rather than performance.

### 2.3 Readiness Levels
Readiness is classified as:
- Initial  
- Emerging  
- Developing  
- Established  
- Strategic  

These align with IMM maturity levels and are used as diagnostic classifications, not maturity targets.

### 2.4 Diagnostic Methods
Includes:
- document review,
- interviews,
- capability mapping,
- systems analysis,
- evidence review,
- funding landscape analysis.

These methods describe evidence categories, not execution steps (OECD, 2020). Execution details are defined in annexes or later phases.

### 2.5 Diagnostic Outputs
- readiness scorecard,
- capability map,
- funding readiness profile,
- governance readiness profile,
- implementation recommendations,
- risks and mitigation pathways.

These outputs are decision artifacts that inform the system architecture in Chapter 03.

### 2.6 Minimum Conditions for Launch
A system may only proceed when:
- mandates are clear,
- funding streams identified,
- governance structures defined,
- hub architecture validated,
- documentation infrastructure prepared.

These are gating thresholds, not recommendations.

### 2.7 Connection to System Architecture
Chapter 03 uses diagnostic outputs to define the architecture of the lab ecosystem, making the diagnostic a direct constraint on design choices.
