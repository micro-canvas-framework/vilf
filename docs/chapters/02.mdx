## 02 – Ecosystem Diagnostic

### 2.1 Purpose of the Diagnostic
The diagnostic evaluates whether an institution, sector, or country is ready to deploy innovation labs, hubs, and networks using VILF. It identifies maturity levels, capability gaps, governance barriers, and funding conditions.

### 2.2 Diagnostic Pillars
The diagnostic evaluates five pillars:
- **Strategic Alignment (MCF)**  
- **Governance (IGF)**  
- **Capability & Maturity (IMM)**  
- **Execution Readiness (IMM-P)**  
- **Infrastructure & Evidence Systems**  

Each pillar has a structured set of indicators.

### 2.3 Readiness Levels
Readiness is classified as:
- Initial  
- Emerging  
- Developing  
- Established  
- Strategic  

These align with IMM maturity levels.

### 2.4 Diagnostic Methods
Includes:
- document review,
- interviews,
- capability mapping,
- systems analysis,
- evidence review,
- funding landscape analysis.

### 2.5 Diagnostic Outputs
- readiness scorecard,
- capability map,
- funding readiness profile,
- governance readiness profile,
- implementation recommendations,
- risks and mitigation pathways.

### 2.6 Minimum Conditions for Launch
A system may only proceed when:
- mandates are clear,
- funding streams identified,
- governance structures defined,
- hub architecture validated,
- documentation infrastructure prepared.

### 2.7 Connection to System Architecture
Chapter 03 uses diagnostic outputs to define the architecture of the lab ecosystem.
