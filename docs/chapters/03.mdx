## 03 – System Architecture

### 3.1 Purpose of the System Architecture
This chapter defines the full structure of a functioning innovation lab ecosystem, including labs, hubs, NCU, evidence flows, governance architecture, documentation systems, and capability spines. It serves as the blueprint on which operations, funding, governance, and scaling are built.

### 3.2 Architectural Layers
VILF architecture includes:
- **Tier-0:** Innovation Labs  
- **Tier-1:** Hubs  
- **Tier-2:** Network Coordination Unit (NCU)  
- **Cross-cutting systems:** evidence, documentation, governance, capability, MEL.

### 3.3 Tier-0: Lab Architecture
Labs are execution units responsible for:
- research and discovery,  
- experimentation and prototyping,  
- validation cycles,  
- solution development,  
- documentation and evidence.

Minimum components:
- lab manager,  
- service/design capability,  
- experimentation capability,  
- evidence officer,  
- subject matter experts (as needed).

### 3.4 Tier-1: Hub Architecture
Hubs support multiple labs through:
- capability building,  
- coaching,  
- portfolio management,  
- MEL and benchmarking,  
- documentation quality assurance,  
- domain knowledge development.

Hubs are intermediaries between labs and the NCU.

### 3.5 Tier-2: Network Coordination Unit Architecture
The NCU governs:
- accreditation,  
- standards,  
- documentation systems,  
- governance and IGF enforcement,  
- MEL synthesis,  
- system-wide reporting.

The NCU is the backbone for interoperability and long-term sustainability.

### 3.6 Cross-Cutting Systems
Five key spines operate across all tiers:
- **Execution Spine (IMM-P)**  
- **Capability Spine (IMM)**  
- **Governance Spine (IGF)**  
- **Performance Spine (MEL)**  
- **Infrastructure Spine (documentation + evidence)**  

These spines ensure coherence across the network.

### 3.7 Evidence Flow & Repository Structure (Reconstructed)
Evidence is the central currency of VILF.  
The repository structure includes:
- research logs,  
- interview notes,  
- experimentation results,  
- prototyping documentation,  
- decision records,  
- governance escalations,  
- MEL outputs.

Evidence must:
- be standardized,  
- be tagged with metadata,  
- follow versioning rules,  
- remain auditable by hubs and NCU.

### 3.8 Infrastructure Spine (Reconstructed)
The infrastructure spine consists of:
- documentation repository,  
- knowledge base,  
- metadata standards,  
- access and permission rules,  
- platform-agnostic storage architecture.

It ensures traceability, interoperability, and transparency.

### 3.9 Governance Spine (Reconstructed)
The governance spine (IGF) defines:
- decision rights across tiers,  
- escalation pathways,  
- governance review cycles,  
- ethics and risk rules.

All architecture components must apply IGF consistently.

### 3.10 Capability Spine (Reconstructed)
The capability spine uses IMM to ensure:
- structured maturity progression,  
- capability mapping,  
- training and coaching pathways,  
- role-based competency growth,  
- performance-linked capability development.

### 3.11 Interoperability Rules Across Labs, Hubs, NCU (Reconstructed)
Interoperability requires:
- shared templates,  
- unified evidence tags,  
- standardized workflows,  
- common governance patterns,  
- shared maturity and performance definitions.

This prevents fragmentation and ensures learnings circulate.

### 3.12 Connection to Operating Model
Chapter 04 operationalizes the architecture into workflows, roles, responsibilities, and execution systems.
