## 06 – Benchmarking

### How to Read This Chapter
Benchmarking enables fair comparison, capability mapping, and evidence-based resource allocation across labs, hubs, and networks.

### 6.1 Purpose of Benchmarking
Benchmarking identifies:
- performance differentials,
- capability gaps,
- high-performing and struggling units,
- system learning opportunities.

### 6.2 Benchmarking Principles
- Normalization  
- Evidence-Based  
- Transparency  
- Comparability  
- Purpose-Driven  
- Continuous Learning  

### 6.3 Benchmarking Architecture

#### 6.3.1 Tier-0
Evaluates:
- IMM-P execution,
- evidence completeness,
- rigor,
- MEL results,
- IGF compliance.

#### 6.3.2 Tier-1
Evaluates:
- capability support,
- portfolio coordination,
- MEL review quality,
- documentation hygiene.

#### 6.3.3 Tier-2
Evaluates:
- interoperability,
- governance consistency,
- documentation flow,
- system learning.

### 6.4 Benchmarking Indicator Groups
- Execution (IMM-P)  
- Capability (IMM)  
- Governance (IGF)  
- MEL indicators  

### 6.5 Normalization Rules
Account for:
- mandates,
- maturity,
- team size,
- domain complexity.

### 6.6 Benchmarking Methods
- comparative,
- longitudinal,
- cluster-based,
- network-level.

### 6.7 Benchmarking Process Flow
1. Indicator verification  
2. Data submission  
3. Normalization  
4. Consolidation  
5. Analysis  
6. MEL integration  
7. Reporting  

### 6.8 Outputs
- benchmarking reports,
- capability plans,
- funding recommendations,
- cross-lab learning priorities.

### 6.9 Connection to KPIs & Scorecard
Benchmarking provides comparative context for KPI interpretation in Chapter 07.
