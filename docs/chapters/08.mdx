## 08 – Roadmap & Phasing

### How to Read This Chapter
This chapter explains how the VILF system operates over time through staged roadmap and phasing logic. It describes system behavior and continuity rather than task execution. Detailed execution practices are addressed in later chapters or annexes.

### 8.1 Purpose
Ensures:
- readiness-driven deployment,
- predictable scaling,
- maturity progression,
- MEL-driven adaptation,
- governance stability.

These intent statements describe operating continuity rather than step-by-step actions.

### 8.2 Phasing Principles
- readiness first,
- evidence over ambition,
- balanced portfolios,
- capability before scale,
- iterative learning,
- Minimum Viable Network,
- risk-managed growth.

The phased model below represents system states and transition conditions rather than operational sequences.

### 8.3 Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1 — Preparation (3–6 months)
Outputs:
- diagnostics,
- architecture,
- operating model,
- funding envelope,
- MEL setup.

Phase 1 establishes the baseline conditions required for controlled system activation.

#### Phase 2 — Wave 1: Pilot Labs (6–12 months)
Outputs:
- pilot scorecards,
- initial hub,
- governance stabilization.

Phase 2 defines the initial operating footprint without prescribing local delivery practices.

#### Phase 3 — Wave 2: Expansion (12–24 months)
Outputs:
- more labs,
- domain clusters,
- national benchmarking.

Phase 3 reflects expansion of system scope and coordination intensity.

#### Phase 4 — Wave 3: National Network (24–48 months)
Outputs:
- multi-hub ecosystem,
- NCU fully operational,
- MEL institutionalized.

Phase 4 represents a stabilized network state with sustained system-level coordination.

### 8.4 Decision Gates
These gates define readiness thresholds that condition movement between phases.
- Gate 1: launch readiness  
- Gate 2: expansion readiness  
- Gate 3: integration readiness  
### 8.5 Capability Roadmap
IMM guides role competency expectations and progression across phases without prescribing delivery methods.

### 8.6 MEL-Driven Adaptation
Quarterly and annual MEL cycles provide feedback loops that refine the roadmap over time.

### 8.7 Scaling Tools
Includes:
- rollout templates,
- accreditation criteria,
- benchmarking processes.

These tools are reference points for consistency, not procedural checklists.

### 8.8 Connection to Governance & Legal Toolkit
Scaling requires legal stability and governance instruments in Chapter 09 to preserve system continuity.
