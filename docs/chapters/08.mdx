## 08 – Roadmap & Phasing

### How to Read This Chapter
This chapter provides the structured rollout plan for launching and scaling innovation lab networks.

### 8.1 Purpose
Ensures:
- readiness-driven deployment,
- predictable scaling,
- maturity progression,
- MEL-driven adaptation,
- governance stability.

### 8.2 Phasing Principles
- readiness first,
- evidence over ambition,
- balanced portfolios,
- capability before scale,
- iterative learning,
- Minimum Viable Network,
- risk-managed growth.

### 8.3 Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1 — Preparation (3–6 months)
Outputs:
- diagnostics,
- architecture,
- operating model,
- funding envelope,
- MEL setup.

#### Phase 2 — Wave 1: Pilot Labs (6–12 months)
Outputs:
- pilot scorecards,
- initial hub,
- governance stabilization.

#### Phase 3 — Wave 2: Expansion (12–24 months)
Outputs:
- more labs,
- domain clusters,
- national benchmarking.

#### Phase 4 — Wave 3: National Network (24–48 months)
Outputs:
- multi-hub ecosystem,
- NCU fully operational,
- MEL institutionalized.

### 8.4 Decision Gates
- Gate 1: launch readiness  
- Gate 2: expansion readiness  
- Gate 3: integration readiness  

### 8.5 Capability Roadmap
IMM guides role competency, training, progression.

### 8.6 MEL-Driven Adaptation
Quarterly and annual MEL cycles refine the roadmap.

### 8.7 Scaling Tools
Includes:
- rollout templates,
- accreditation criteria,
- benchmarking processes.

### 8.8 Connection to Governance & Legal Toolkit
Scaling requires legal stability and governance instruments (Chapter 09).
