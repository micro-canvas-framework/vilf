# Citation Plan — Chapter Coverage (BL-16A)

This plan defines where citations are expected and at what intensity, without
introducing any sources yet. It preserves the normative vs explanatory boundary
and keeps the framework practitioner-first.

## Legend
- NONE: no citations by design (normative framework content)
- LIGHT: minimal grounding for context statements
- MODERATE: alignment references to external standards or institutions
- HEAVY: empirical or regulatory grounding (if applicable)

## Chapter-Level Plan

| Chapter | Section types (non-exhaustive) | Citation expectation | Example source types (no specific sources) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 Executive Summary | Purpose, scope, structure overview | NONE | None (normative orientation) |
| 01 Introduction | Context framing, positioning, principles | LIGHT | Multilateral frameworks, academic overview texts |
| 02 Ecosystem Diagnostic | Pillars, readiness levels, outputs | MODERATE | Government diagnostics, institutional readiness models |
| 03 System Architecture | Tiers, spines, system components | NONE | None (internal architecture) |
| 04 Operating Model | Roles, workflows, governance interfaces | NONE | None (internal operating logic) |
| 05 Funding Model | Funding streams, sustainability logic | MODERATE | Public finance frameworks, development institutions |
| 06 Benchmarking | Indicator groups, comparative lenses | MODERATE | Benchmarking methodologies, evaluation standards |
| 07 KPIs & Scorecard | KPI domains, scorecard logic | MODERATE | MEL standards, performance measurement frameworks |
| 08 Roadmap & Phasing | Phasing logic, decision gates | LIGHT | Program roll-out guidance, change management literature |
| 09 Governance & Legal Toolkit | Governance tiers, legal instruments | MODERATE | Governance standards, regulatory guidance, public law references |
| 10 Templates & Tools | Template domains, tool categories | NONE | None (internal tooling taxonomy) |
| 11 References | Reference lists and external frameworks | HEAVY | Academic literature, multilateral references, standards bodies |
| 12 License | License model and constraints | NONE | None (license text is canonical) |
| 13 Release Notes | Version history | NONE | None (factual internal record) |
| 14 Roadmap (Future Versions) | Horizon framing | LIGHT | Foresight and roadmap methodology (if used) |
| 15 Annexes | Annex list and structure | NONE | None (annexes carry their own sources) |

## Placement Rules
- Citations appear only in explanatory text, not in normative statements.
- References sections are added only to chapters that contain citations.
- Annexes may carry citations later under their own BL-16 tasks if required.
