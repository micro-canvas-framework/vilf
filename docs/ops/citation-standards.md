# Citation Standards & Harvard Conventions — VILF 1.0

## 1. Citation Philosophy
VILF cites selectively to preserve a practitioner-first framework while grounding
external claims and alignments. The distinction is:
- Normative framework claims: internal constructs and rules; do not cite.
- Explanatory context: general framing; cite only if factual or external.
- External alignment references: cite when referencing standards, institutions,
  or published research.

## 2. Citation Eligibility Rules
Claims that REQUIRE citations:
- Empirical or statistical statements.
- References to external standards, policies, or regulatory texts.
- Summaries of published research or institutional guidance.
- Assertions about observed practices or industry benchmarks.

Claims that MUST NOT be cited:
- VILF definitions and internal taxonomies.
- Governance rules, decision rights, or framework obligations.
- Canonical terminology (e.g., IMM-P® usage).
- Internal process descriptions when presented as VILF design choices.

## 3. Source Classes
Allowed:
- Peer-reviewed academic literature.
- Multilateral institutions (OECD, UN, World Bank, ISO, WEF, etc.).
- Government or regulatory documents.
- Reputable industry research with clear methodology.

Discouraged (use sparingly, justify):
- General press coverage.
- Opinion pieces without data.

Prohibited:
- Blogs or marketing sites without research methodology.
- AI-generated text or unsourced summaries.
- Anonymous or unverifiable sources.

## 4. Harvard Style Conventions
In-text format:
- Single author: (Surname, Year)
- Two authors: (Surname and Surname, Year)
- Three+ authors: (Surname et al., Year)
- Institutional author: (Institution, Year)
- Multiple citations: (Author, Year; Author, Year)
- Same author, same year: (Author, 2020a; Author, 2020b)

Reference list:
- Place a References section at the end of each chapter that includes citations.
- Include full bibliographic entries in Harvard style.
- Only include sources actually cited in that chapter.

## 5. MDX Implementation Rules
- Use inline Harvard-style citations in the prose (not footnotes).
- Add a "References" heading at the end of the chapter if citations exist.
- Do not include reference lists on chapters with no citations.
- No footnotes unless explicitly approved later.
