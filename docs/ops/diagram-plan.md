# Diagram Inventory and Placement Plan (BL-15A)

This plan identifies candidate locations for explanatory diagrams. It does not
introduce new concepts or commit to diagram insertion. All candidates must be
validated against chapter text before any diagram work begins.

## Candidate Table (Chapters 00?15)

## Notes
- Defer items flagged "Y" until BL-15 review confirms no implied sequencing or commitments.
- All diagram insertions must follow docs/ops/diagram-standards.md.
