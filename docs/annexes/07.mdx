title: Annex 07 — Documentation & Evidence Standards
sidebar_label: Annex 07 — Evidence Standards
---


## 07.1 Purpose
This annex defines the standardized documentation and evidence requirements for all VILF-compliant labs, hubs, and the Network Coordination Unit (NCU).  
It ensures documentation integrity, auditability, transparency, and interoperability across the innovation ecosystem.

## 07.2 Evidence Principles
All evidence must be:
- **Complete** — all IMM-P® stages must include required artifacts  
- **Traceable** — decisions, changes, and iterations must be recorded  
- **Versioned** — repository retains chronological history  
- **Auditable** — evidence must support MEL and accreditation  
- **Accessible** — clearly named, properly stored, searchable  

## 07.3 Evidence Repository Structure
Standard folder hierarchy:

/evidence
/00-pre-discovery
/01-discovery
/02-validation
/03-efficiency
/04-scaling
/05-continuous-improvement
/governance
/risks
/prototypes
/experiments
/maturity
/mel


## 07.4 Metadata Requirements
Every file must include a metadata header:

- Title  
- Author  
- Date  
- IMM-P® Stage  
- Version  
- Evidence Type  
- Related Decision Record(s)  
- Tags  

## 07.5 Decision Record Format
All decisions must be logged using the following fields:

- Decision title  
- Context  
- Evidence used  
- Options considered  
- Final decision  
- Responsible person  
- Date  
- Escalation status  
- Link(s) to related evidence  

## 07.6 Prototyping & Experimentation Logs

### Prototyping Log (Minimum Fields)
- Prototype version  
- Objective  
- Features tested  
- Feedback received  
- Iteration notes  

### Experiment Log (Minimum Fields)
- Hypothesis  
- Method  
- User group  
- Results  
- Interpretation  
- Next steps  

## 07.7 Repository Hygiene Rules
- No duplicate files  
- No orphan evidence (all files must map to a stage)  
- No undocumented decisions  
- No “final_v2_final_really_final” filenames  
- Version numbering: `v1`, `v1.1`, `v2`, etc.  
- Annual evidence consolidation required  

## 07.8 Licensing
All repository structures and templates are released under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
