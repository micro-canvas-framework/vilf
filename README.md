# Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF)

VILF is a Doulab framework for designing and operating **Innovation Lab Networks** with governance, capability development, and evidence-backed execution integrity.

This repository is the canonical, version-controlled home of the VILF 1.0 documentation and its Docusaurus site.
